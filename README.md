### CAU-Net (An Anisotropic Attention Model with Centerline Constraint for Vascular Segmentation)

- CAU-Net is composed of two sub-networks, namely b_Net (Backbone Network) and a_Net (Auxiliary Network). 
- B_Net is the backbone network for vascular segmentation. 
- A_Net is the auxiliary network with centerline constraints.
